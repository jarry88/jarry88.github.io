## üåü Featured Projects  
### 1. Enterprise ERP System (Supply Chain Module)  
- Led development of core supply chain functions (PO management, inventory tracking, supplier reconciliation) supporting 100+ concurrent users.  
- Reduced order processing error rate by 42% via optimized data validation logic; cut manual reconciliation workload by 120+ hours/month for 3 business units.  
- Tech Stack: Python (Django) + Vue.js + MySQL + RESTful API  

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline for ERP Deployment  
- Built automated pipeline with GitLab CI + Docker, covering code commit ‚Üí auto-test ‚Üí multi-env (dev/test/prod) deployment.  
- Shortened deployment cycle from 2 days to 15 mins; achieved **0 deployment failures** in 1 year.  
- Implemented real-time pipeline logging & error alerts (Email/WeChat Work) for DevOps team.  

### 3. AI Model Prototype for Business Data Analysis  
- Built a lightweight demand forecasting prototype using Python (Pandas + ARIMA model) to analyze historical sales data (10k+ records).  
- Validated model performance with 82% accuracy on test data; designed a simple visualization dashboard to display forecast trends.  
- Explored integration paths with existing business systems (e.g., ERP inventory module) for potential efficiency improvements.  

### 4. Full-Stack Todo List Application (Personal Project)  
- Developed a responsive Todo List app with full CRUD functionality, supporting task categorization (work/study/life) and deadline reminders.  
- Backend: Built RESTful API with Node.js (Express) + MongoDB for data storage; implemented JWT authentication for user login.  
- Frontend: Designed interactive UI with React + Tailwind CSS, supporting dark/light mode toggle and task drag-and-drop sorting.  
- Deployment: Hosted on Vercel (frontend) & Mysql  (database), ensuring 99.9% uptime; added CI/CD via GitHub Actions for auto-deployment on code push.

## üìà Current Focus & Todo List  
### Short-Term Goals (Next 1-3 Months)  
1. Enhance ERP Reporting: Integrate Power BI for custom data visualization dashboards ( collect requirements phase).  
2. AI-ERP Integration: Add inventory turnover prediction to ERP (data collection & model training in progress).  
3. CI/CD Upgrade: Build pipeline monitoring bots for instant failure notifications (target: 2 weeks).  

### Long-Term Vision  
Leverage AI & automation to create self-optimizing ERP systems that adapt to dynamic industrial/enterprise demands.
